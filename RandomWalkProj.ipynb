        "\n",
        "So our goal is to find the largest $t$ such that $P(t) > .5$. Of course part of the problem is finding a formula for $P(t)$ for us to work with but lets try make our lives easier by finding $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ individually. We can count the total number of unique paths after taking $t$ step, and get $B(t) = 4^t$. This is because after each step, we have four new directions we can move in. Now for a given time we need to now all the paths than end up with and endpoint at most a distance 4 from the origin. With a little bit of counting (see way below) we can deduce the total number of end points that are at most distance 4 from the origin. The problem is that there is no clear way to find the number of paths after taking $t$ steps that end at a specific end point. Things get complicated because paths can double back. For example, for a path of length 2, there are four paths that end up at the origin by taking one step in any direction then stepping back. Now for paths of length 100, its not so clear how to count the number of total paths that end at the origin -- we might take 50 steps east then some back, or 1 step east and back a total of 50 times. There are many other possible paths that will end at the origin. There is also no symmetry to exploit since other end points might only have 1 single path that reaches them. For example, for a walk of length $t$, the the end point (0,100) will only have one path that reaches it. All this is to say there is no clear way to count the paths that will result in an end point whos distance is at most 4 for a general path of length $t$."
